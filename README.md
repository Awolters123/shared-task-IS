# shared-task-IS

## General information
This repository contains our baseline (and baseline testing process) for [SemEval 2023 - Task 10 - Explainable Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS)](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/7124).
This shared task is a part of the course *Shared Task Information Science* at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/).

It contains two Jupyter notebook files containing all the work we (group 3) did for the baseline.
The best model can be found in the *best_model.ipynb*, and the general decision process can be found in *Shared_task_IS.ipynb*.

## Working with the Jupyter notebook files

### Opening the files
To make use of the Jupyter notebook file, it is recommended that a proper Jupyter notebook viewer is used, options include:
- Jupyter notebook
- Google colab
- vscode

### Checking the results
For both aforementioned files (see [General Information](##-General-information)), outcomes have already been generated as part of the Jupyter notbooks. These results were used by the team as the final output.

### Running The Code
In case one wants to regenerate the outcomes of the Jupyter notebook (or make changes), one can simply *run all* code. More information about these features can be found in the guides for the specific tool that is being used.

After this, the results should be the same as before (unless changes have been made).
